# ReLooted
The loot in 3.7.x/3.8.0 is rather underwhelming. Almost half the spawn points that were present in 3.6.1 are missing. This mod injects the loot files from 3.6.1 for a much greater experience.

What this mod does is fairly simple. It takes the loot files from 3.6.1 and inject them into 3.8.0 while leaving quest items spawns intact.

THIS MOD DOES NOT OVERWRITE ANY FILES WITHIN SPT. IT INJECTS THEM INTO THE GAME AT LOAD TIME EVERY TIME THE SERVER STARTS

By default this has quite a bit higher loot quantity than the default tables in current versions, so you might want to use a mod like LootFuckery or SVM (or both really) to adjust the loot rates to what you feel happy with.
